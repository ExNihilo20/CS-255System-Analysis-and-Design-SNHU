## DriverPass Project and Client
The DriverPass project centers around a ficticious company that wants to address a market need - a lack of quality training for those attempting their driver license test. The company owner - Liam - wants to offer students a learning package that includes online learning options, online testing materials, and in-person driver lessons behind the wheel with an instructor. Liam wants to interface with the DMV in order to receive updates when new content is added to the DMV's driver learning requirements.

## Project Highlights
The Business Requirements Document (BRD) was effective at grabbing all details related to customer requirements for the DriverPass system. System design, system purpose, components of the system, objectives, and goals were all accounted for in this high-level planning document. The BRD also handled functional and non-functional requirements. The functional requirements contained specific examples of what functions the project should carry out while in use. The non-functional requirements addressed concerns such as:
- scalability
- uptime needs
- security needs
- usability
- maintainability

The System Design Document (SDD) shows a number of diagrams which detail various aspects of the DriverPass system. The document shows a case Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram, where customers, administrators, and staff interact with various system functions. The SDD also shows activity UML diagrams related to user login and authentication/authorization protocols, which will be used whenever someone access the system. Sometimes one view is not enough to understand a project facet, so there is a UML sequence diagram to further explain the login and authentication process for system users. This document also has a UML class diagram that shows system components and the general project structure, and does a great job of graphically illustrating abstract project ideas.

## Areas for Improvement 
I would redo the Assumptions section of the BRD if I had to pick anything. While some assumptions are included, this list could be expanded upon. Further clarification could be added to this section as well. Some aspects, like internet connectivity or standard security measures, take time to explain and could be expanded upon. Furthermore, the SDD case diagram could be revised. The document shows some external actors and some functional activity, but the diagram could be fine-tuned to further elaborate on system functions.
 
## How the Documents Interpret User Needs
The documents gave a structured approach to the client's needs. The BRD starts by summarizing the client's requirements and then - one by one - addresses various parts of the system, their purpose, the background behind them, their objectives, and the project's function/non-functional requirements. Both the BRD and the SDD address the user interface needs, but the BRD directly addresses system assumptions and limitations. The BRD also includes a Gantt chart for the project's timeline! 

## Why are User Needs Important
Considering the user's needs is important because they are the primary funding source for the system. The users decide whether they will interact with a system, and how much they will spend on services that a system offers.

## How do I Approach Design
The design process should be user-centric, because the user is the reason that the designs are made in the first place. The process should be systematic as opposed to being done without a structure or all at once. Overall objectives, functionality, non-functional requirements, business requirements, and more should be taken from all project shareholders during the planning stages for the betterment of all parties. 

An analysis of the target market will help to drill down on exactly how a particular user demographic will likely use a system's offerings. The design of any system should reflect that demographic's preferences in regard to features, functionality, interface, and more. Ideology should be set aside, as the system is for the user. This is difficult when the majority of public funding comes from only a few key investment firms, but great strides should be made to focus on the user him or herself.
