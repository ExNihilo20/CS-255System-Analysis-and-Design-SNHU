## DriverPass Project and Client
The DriverPass project centers around a ficticious company that wants to address a market need - a lack of quality training for those attempting their driver license test. The company owner - Liam - wants to offer students a learning package that includes online learning options, online testing materials, and in-person driver lessons behind the wheel with an instructor. Liam wants to interface with the DMV in order to receive updates when new content is added to the DMV's driver learning requirements.

The non-functional requirements addressed concerns such as:
- scalability
- uptime needs
- security needs
- usability
- maintainability
